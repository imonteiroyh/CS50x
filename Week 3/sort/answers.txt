sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: In the test with the sorted5000.txt file, sort1 got the better performance.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: In all tests, the time to sort with sort2 is nearly equal (and less than the time to sort with sort3), what is explained by it's complexity O(nlogn).

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: In all tests, the time to sort with sort3 is nearly equal (and bigger than the time to sort with sort2), what is explained by it's complexity O(n^2).
