Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I believed that the time would be low for 10, 100 or 1000 simulations, however, i did not think
that these three N would take such a similar time.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After about 1000 simulations, the precisions becabe stable, at least in the first eigth positions,
so i believe that, for the time (since it is very similar to the time of N = 10 simulations or
N = 100 simulations) it would be a good enough amount of simulations.
